The world is a dangerous place, Elliott, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing. We’re all living in each other’s paranoia. The only thing that’s real is this moment. This exact moment. I'm not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning hacker. Power belongs to the people that take it. The problem is not that there is evil in the world. The problem is that there is good. Because otherwise, who would care? Money can't buy happiness, but it can make you awfully comfortable while you're being miserable. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children? Or maybe it’s that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit. The world itself is just one big hoax. I don't like deleting files. The digital ones and zeroes are still out there. All it takes is a different access point. I'm not a leader, Elliot. I'm a soldier. The difference between reality and fiction? Fiction has to make sense. A bug is never just a mistake. It represents something bigger. An error of thinking. That makes you who you are. The world is a better place without you in it. The world is a better place when it's blurry, mixed-up, a little cold like this, and I don't care. You’re not your job. You’re not how much money you have in the bank. You’re not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You’re not your f***ing khakis. Sometimes lies are more dependable than the truth. The only way to survive a mad world is to embrace the madness. This is what happens when you hack a country. You get their attention. We're all living in each other's paranoia, remember? Control is an illusion, which makes total chaos so damn exciting.
